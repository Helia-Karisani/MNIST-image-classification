# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using Feedforward Neural Network (MNIST)

This project implements a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** — also known as a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** — to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

- The model learns to recognize digits **0–9** from 28×28 grayscale images.  
- It uses two hidden layers with ReLU activation and a softmax output layer.  
- The network is trained using **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** optimizer and **categorical cross-entropy** loss.  
- Performance is evaluated on the MNIST test set and visualized with prediction plots.

## 🧩 Model Architecture

| Layer | Type | Units | Activation |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Dense (Hidden) | 128 | ReLU |
| 2 | Dense (Hidden) | 128 | ReLU |
| 3 | Dense (Output) | 10 | Softmax |

## ⚙️ Key Steps
1. **Data Loading** – MNIST digits from `keras.datasets.mnist`.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Flatten 28×28 images into 784-length vectors and normalize pixels (0–1).  
3. **Encoding Labels** – One-hot encoding using `to_categorical()`.  
4. **Model Building** – `Sequential` model with 3 dense layers.  
5. **Training** – Optimizer = `SGD`, Loss = `categorical_crossentropy`, Metric = `accuracy`.  
6. **Evaluation & Visualization** – Test accuracy and grid of predictions with color-coded results.
